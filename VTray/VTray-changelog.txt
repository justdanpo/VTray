- To do:
  - Protection of weird char in *On command (ex: <7)
  - Check per pixel alpha support
  - Use getrccoordinate in lsbox hook and use lsbox size for maxsize positioning?
  - Use real icon routines to avoid magic pink with smooth icons, test:
	why is creating icons from hbmBuffer making the icons display in half size (16->8), while outline is correct size?

  - Invalidating whole window on icon update again, forgot that the bg needed painting ;)
  - Fix a missing endpaint() in the iconbuffer creation

- Changed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2003-01-22]
  - Added a bitmap buffer for each icon that is used when tinting is on
  - Moved tinting to set icon, so the tinted icon is only updated when icon is,
    not on all redraws like before, reduces cpu usage with tinting on quite a lot.

- Added [systray2 / Vendicator / 2003-01-18]
  - Added setting SystrayCheckOnCommands to check the oncommands if using dynamic vars
  - Fixed so that the evars are exported last now (found that it did the previous size before)

  - Fixed autosizing always happening in !refresh

- Fixed [systray2 / Ilmcuts / 2002-09-08]
  - OnNumList2, ignoreTag, and flashTag weren't initialized to NULL in the constructor.

  - Fixed update check to only use the title and not icon change, will allow for
    hiding of zonealarm for instance
  - Jesus_mjjg's fix temporarily disabled until the reason why systray also sets
    it self above all windows is determined

- Fixed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-08-12]
  - Fixed a small mem leak (2bytes per flash config read)
  - Merged icon removal between hidden&shown icons
  - Tweaked more code to save some cycles here and there

- Fixed [systray2 / Jesus_mjjg / 2002-07-26]
  - Shouldn't tooltip windows be always on top of any other window ?
    now they are (but maybe i could make that cleaner)

- Added [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-07-18]
  - Added setting "SystrayAlwaysFlashOnMatch", which continues to flash an icon even when
    icon is activated, this means that it will only stop when the match of the icon stops
	(ie icon removed, or tooltip doesn't match no more). If used with no tooltip and a
	flash limit, it the icon will only be able to flash once (since that is always matched).

- Fixed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-07-09]
  - Added an extra #define so that whichever strange os/msvc version can compile this again.

- Changed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-07-08]
  - Changed flash format to:
	*systrayflash "classname" "title (optional)" flashes/update
	to be able to specify max flashes, 0 to flash until you click the icon.
	This means that the icon won't flash anymore until you activate it (even if it's updated again).
  - Added setting "SystrayFlashInScreensaver", to specify if flashing should
    occur even when a screensaver is running, the flashing will most likely turn off the screensaver.

- Fixed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-07-02]
  - Rewrote the adjustsize algorithm, previous seemed to fail sometimes when hiding icons
  - Moved more code around, most settings read through functions, makes editing startup behaviour easier (!refresh, !recycle, startup)
  - Fixed !refresh some more... sometime tray isn't visible in lsbox, when does this happen?
  - Fixed a bug in the move code
  - Added systrayAlign which accepts a string like "right bottom" to define from which corner
    systray should be placed, defined size might give strange results.

- Added [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-07-01]
  - Added output of window classes to log file (lv3) on !systrayinfo for easier config of hiding/flashing
  - Added scroll flashing on icon update through code from taskbar3,
    needs window classname, optional tooltip text (case sensitive, check log file).
  - Added mouse enter / leave !bang running.
  - Restructured how checks flash&hide checks are made, saves some cycles.
  - Fixed *Wharfmodule from LSBox, thanks to someone who I lost the mail from for pointing it out.
  - Started implementation of !refresh... still a little flaky
  - Ilmcuts noticed that the previous hue code used BGR format, changed to RGB even though a warning
    from grd was present in the code, but it's checked and doesn't appear to have any problems.

- Fixed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-06-17]
  - On recycle the remove commands were removed before run, fixed.

    now closed when it loses focus!

  - Did some code cleanup & added some more logging with #ifdef
  - Fixed saturation misspelling =)

  - fixed warnings about signed/unsigned int conflicts
  - tweaked wharf/lsbox compatibility (hopefully positive)
  - misc tweaks (thanks to Maduin for the new ontop code)

- Added [systray2 / Vendicator 2002-06-06]

- Fixed [systray2 / Sci / 2002-05-22]
  - Multiline tooltips now works (DUN icon)

- Added [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-05-17]
  - Implemented icon hiding base on window class name.
    Format: *systrayhide Window_Class_Name min_inactive_before_hiding
  - Added SystrayIconTimer, which set how often to do the check for inactive icons
    defaults to every minute, setting 0 disables check.
  - Added !SystrayShowIcons to display any hidden icons.
  - Added some logging, watch out on loglevel 4 =)
  - Rewrote the systray2kad stuff to skip vector notation...
  - Todo: Testing

- Problem [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-05-06]
  - Works in lsbox and on desktop, but I'm guessing not in a wharf...

- Fixed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-05-05]
  - Added compensation for lsbox position, needed when using autoresize in lsbox.
  - Entered the systray2kad hacks for command execution on add/del of icons.

- Fixed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-05-02]
  - Added lsbox support, seems to hide if the tray resizes, watch of with autoresize...

- Fixed [systray2 / Vendicator / 2002-04-15]
  - Now using GetRCCoordinates to get X,Y position

- Fixed [systray2 / Message / 2001-11-26]
  - Stripped everything out of it except for basic gui, this modulewill not run
    without a new build

- Fixed [systray2 / Message / 2001-11-21]
  - Added Windows2000 and WindowxXP support. Seems to work fine when first loaded,
    but after a recycle w2k loses its volume icon and xp loses all icons (?). A simple fix
    for w2k is to run trayfix.exe after a recycle, and that will put the volume icon back.

    NOTES:
    The DUN icon uses 4 icons to display status, when NIM_ADD the icons, they all have the
    same HWND, but differ in NOTIFYICONDATA.uID. To get around this, we only check to see
    if an icon already exists by HWND only, and not uID. On NIM_MODIFY, we set the uID
    of any found icon to the modifying icon's uID or problems occur with the mouse handling.

    UnloadShellServiceObjects needs to be called before LM_SAVESYSTRAY is handled or
    the DUN/Volume icons get saved also and won't be handled properly when the tray is
    restarted after a recycle.

    (The tooltip on the DUN icon still doesn't handle well. I think this is our implementation
    and not MS related.) - Fixed by Sci
